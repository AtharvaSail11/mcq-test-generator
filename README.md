# MCQ Test Generator

I built a full-stack MCQ Test Generator web application using React.js, Node.js, and Firebase that allows users to create and manage tests in two flexible modes: AI Mode and JSON Mode. 

## AI Mode

In AI Mode, users upload a document which is processed by the backend and sent to the Gemini API to automatically generate MCQs.

## JSON Mode

JSON Mode lets users manually paste structured question data for unlimited test creation, with built-in validation and auto-repair for minor JSON errors.

## Some features of This Web app

The app includes user authentication, securely stores submitted tests, and provides a dashboard where users can view past tests and results, making it a complete and practical assessment-generation platform.

## Final Verdict

That's all there is for now! I am Improving it and will adding new features in the upcoming updates.
